        Provençal wine comes from the French wine-producing region of Provence
        in southeast France. The Romans called the area provincia nostra ("our
        province"), giving the region its name.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just south of the Alps, it was the first Roman province outside Italy.
        Wine has been made in this region for at least 2,600 years, ever since
        the ancient Greeks founded the city of Marseille in 600 BC. Throughout
        the region's history, viticulture and winemaking have been influenced by
        the cultures that have been present in Provence, which include the
        Ancient Greeks, Romans, Gauls, Catalans and Savoyards. These diverse
        groups introduced a large variety of grapes to the region, including
        grape varieties of Greek and Roman origin as well as Spanish, Italian
        and traditional French wine grapes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today the region is known predominantly for its rosé wine, which
        currently accounts for more than half of the production of Provençal
        wine, with red wine accounting for about a third of the region's
        production. White wine is also produced in small quantities throughout
        the region with the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) region of
        Cassis specializing in white wine production. The Côtes de Provence is
        the largest AOC followed by the Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence.
